}

// I did the code just as you did in class but it only displays the last object class and doesn't change. the model on teachablemachine
// worked perfectly. I've tried troubleshooting for an hour but made no progress. I hope this is acceptable. If you explained
// the issue in class after you said we could leave the meeting, then sorry that I missed it.
